## What You'll Do Tomorrow (5 minutes total)

### Step 1: Create Railway Account
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Login"
3. Sign in with your GitHub account
4. (Railway will see your repository from today)

### Step 2: Deploy Your App
1. Click "New Project"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose "Credit Card Tracking Spreadsheet" repository
4. Railway starts building automatically

### Step 3: Add Database
1. In your project dashboard, click "New"
2. Select "Database" → "Add PostgreSQL"
3. Railway creates a free PostgreSQL database
4. (Database automatically connects to your app)

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment
- Railway automatically:
  - Installs dependencies
  - Creates database tables
  - Imports your offer data
  - Starts your app

### Step 5: Get Your Live URL
1. Click on your web service in Railway dashboard
2. Look for "Domains" section
3. Copy the URL (like `yourapp.railway.app`)
4. Visit your live app!

## What to Expect

- **Build Time**: 2-3 minutes for first deployment
- **URL**: Railway gives you a free `yourapp.railway.app` domain
- **Cost**: $5/month (includes PostgreSQL database)
- **Features**: Identical to your local app, but accessible anywhere
